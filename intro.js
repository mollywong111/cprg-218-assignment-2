  description.innerHTML ='There are about 1,000 Moai statues at Easter Island, some weighing up to 86 tons and standing 10 meters tall. Around 95% of the statues were carved from the volcano Rano Raraku. This spot was chosen because it has a lot of tuff, a type of soft volcanic rock. Tuff is easy to carve, which was important since the natives didn’t have metal tools and used stone tools called Toki instead.';

    description.innerHTML ='When the first European ship reached Easter Island in 1722, all the statues were still standing. Over the years, visitors observed more statues falling, and by the late 1800s, none were left standing. The most widely accepted theory is that the statues were intentionally pushed over during tribal conflicts to dishonor rival groups. This idea is supported by the fact that most statues fell face-down into the ground. Another legend speaks of Nuahine Pīkea Uri, a woman with powerful mana (spiritual energy). In her anger, she caused the statues to fall when her four children left her without food. Some elders on Easter Island continue to believe this story.';
